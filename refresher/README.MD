# Information

Some information about the scripts: 

1. *struct_by_ref*: A script for passing C++ structs by reference (*&*)

2. *matr_bas_opers*: Performing basic matrix operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div)

3. *cnt_char*: Count number of times a character appears in a string using file handling. 

4. *upper_lower_case*: Count upper and lower case alphabets from a string using file handling. 

> [!CAUTION]
> *matr_bas_opers* would go into an infinite loop if the user enters a wrong character. This is because the *cin* buffer is not cleared when going into the iteration of the loop.
